### Colony

High level constructs relating to the management and organization of a colony (room).

A colony is organized into battalions, groups of agents collaborating to achieve an objective.

The colony orchestrates these battalions, creating new ones as the colony grows with objectives applicable to the current room control level.


### Creep Profiles

In order to best achieve certain objectives, battalions can request spawn of particular creep profiles which are manually tuned to be the most efficient for particular tasks.

The colony collects the spawn requests and assign them to the spawn actor. It estimates the amount of energy consumed vs produced to balance out the spawning
