## Agents

Agents are high level operators for controllers.

Agents manage the list of tasks, which are scheduled by the current objective.

### Ideas

* Squat (1-10)  /  Platoon (10-50)  /  Battalion (50+) grouping of units with their own objective cycle
* Status system so agents can report what they notice while executing tasks
* Private message inbox, so specific agents can be sent to do specific things by other agents that may not be part of the same group
